This repo reimplements the seamless cloning in the paper "Possion Image Editing".

Just run the following command and you will get the final edited image in the folder ./results.

```
bash test.sh
```
You can freely use all data in the folder `./data`, and change the corresponding parameters (path, pos and..) in the `test.sh`.
